# üåÄ Demos for *A Bayesian View of Inverse Problems*  
Companion repository for the tutorial by Jeremias Sulam at Plurinational Bayes (Colombia) [link](https://slides.com/jeremiassulam/bayes_pluri/fullscreen?token=p_EFOrKa)

## üìñ Overview
This repository contains a couple of **interactive demos and code examples** accompanying the tutorial *‚ÄúComputational Inverse Problems‚Äù*.  
The material introduces inverse problems, progressing from simple analytical examples to modern learned reconstruction techniques.

The goal is to provide participants with hands-on intuition for:
- How inverse problems arise in imaging and signal processing  
- How regularization and priors shape solutions  
- How proximal algorithms (ISTA) connect optimization and inference  
- How modern learned priors and networks generalize classical approaches  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
This code is intended as a **starting point for exploration**.  
It was developed quickly for instructional purposes, and **minor errors or inconsistencies may be present**.
