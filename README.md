## üìñ Overview
This repository contains a series of **interactive demos and code examples** accompanying the tutorial *‚ÄúA Bayesian View of Inverse Problems‚Äù*.  
The material introduces inverse problems from **variational, Bayesian, and data-driven perspectives**, progressing from simple analytical examples to modern learned reconstruction techniques.

The goal is to provide participants with hands-on intuition for:
- How inverse problems arise in imaging and signal processing  
- How regularization and priors shape solutions  
- How proximal algorithms (ISTA/FISTA) connect optimization and inference  
- How modern learned priors and networks generalize classical approaches
